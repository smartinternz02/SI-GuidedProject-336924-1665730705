                             Trip Based Modeling of Fuel Consumption in Modern Fleet Vehicles Using IBM Watson
                             
                             
    Now a days most of the fuel is consumed by fleet vehicles Reduction in fuel consumption by these vehicles by just a few percent can 
    significantly reduce costs for the transportation industry The main objective of this project is to estimation of fuel consumption
    (fuel consumed in L/km) can help to analyze emissions as well as prevent fuel-related frauds Reduction of cosumption of these fuel
    may decrease pollution A simulation model was developed based on engine capacity, fuel injection, fuel specification,and atmospheric 
    conditions, with simulated dynamic driving conditions to predict fuel consumption The best model was selected in order to further
    adjust the performance for high accuracy in classifying Ability to model and predict the fuel consumption is vital in enhancing fuel 
    economy of vehicles and preventing fraudulent activities in fleet management. Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several
    internal & external factors However, not all these factors may be measured or available for the fuel consumption analysis. The main
    aim of the project is to build Machine Learning algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of fleet vehicles based on the gas type .
    A web application is built using ibm watson which is machine learning technique
